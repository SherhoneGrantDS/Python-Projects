# 🛡️ Unique Password Checker Project 🛡️

## Introduction
The Unique Password Checker project is a Python script designed to check if a password is unique compared to a list of common passwords. It aims to improve security by identifying passwords that are commonly used and therefore more vulnerable to attacks.

## Features
- Checks if a password is unique compared to a predefined list of common passwords.
- Provides feedback on whether the password is considered safe or not.
- Offers suggestions for creating stronger passwords if the input password is found to be common.

## How it Works
1. 🖥️ The user inputs a password to be checked.
2. 🛡️ The script compares the input password against a list of common passwords.
3. 📋 If the input password is found in the list of common passwords, the script notifies the user and provides suggestions for creating a stronger password.
4. ✅ If the input password is not found in the list of common passwords, the script confirms that the password is unique and safe to use.

## Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python: The project is implemented in Python programming language, making use of its string manipulation and file handling capabilities.
- 📄 Text File: A text file containing a list of common passwords is used as a reference for comparison.

## Usage
To use the Unique Password Checker project:
1. 📥 Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. ⚙️ Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. ▶️ Run the Python script `unique_password_checker.py`.
4. 🔄 Follow the on-screen prompts to input a password for checking.
5. 📢 Receive feedback on the uniqueness and strength of the password.

## Example
Here's an example of how the Unique Password Checker project can be used:

```
$ python unique_password_checker.py
Enter a Password: password123
The password 'password123' is not unique and is commonly used.
Consider choosing a stronger password to improve security.
