# üñºÔ∏è Image Downloader üñºÔ∏è

The Image Downloader is a Python script designed to automate the process of downloading images from the web. It allows users to specify a list of URLs pointing to images, and the script downloads these images to a local directory on their machine.

## Features
- Downloads images from a list of specified URLs.
- Supports downloading images from various websites, including image hosting platforms and direct image URLs.
- Customizable options for specifying the destination directory and file naming conventions.
- Ability to handle errors and retries for robust image downloading.

## How it Works
1. **Input URLs**: The user provides a list of URLs pointing to the images they want to download.
2. **Download Process**: The script iterates through the list of URLs and downloads each image to the specified destination directory.
3. **Error Handling**: If any errors occur during the downloading process, such as invalid URLs or network issues, the script handles them gracefully and may attempt retries.
4. **Completion Message**: Once all images have been successfully downloaded, the script provides a completion message indicating the total number of images downloaded.

## Technologies Used
- üêç Python: The project is implemented in Python programming language, making use of its built-in libraries for handling HTTP requests and file operations.
- üì∂ Requests Library: Used for making HTTP requests to download images from URLs.
- üñºÔ∏è Pillow Library: Utilized for processing and saving images in various formats.
